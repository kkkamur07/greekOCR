"""Environment settings for the inference runtime.

Nothing here reaches a database. The inference runtime reads a registry file and
runs models; the only job queue is the platform's (ADR 0003).

Nothing here opens a port either. ADR 0002 deleted the loopback service, so
there is no listener whose callers need authenticating and therefore no service
secret: an **inference agent** presents its **device credential** to the
platform, outbound, and nothing presents anything to it.
