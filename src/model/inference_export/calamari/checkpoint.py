"""Load a tensor-only Calamari checkpoint into the runtime Torch graph.

Loading a pickled checkpoint executes code, so this module never unpickles:
``torch.load`` runs with ``weights_only=True``, and the caller has already
verified the **artifact SHA-256** through ``architectures.artifact`` before the
path reaches here.

Export-time code under ADR 0006: the runtime graph runs as ``.onnx``, and this
loader, alongside the exporter beside it, supports that path rather than
serving inference directly.
