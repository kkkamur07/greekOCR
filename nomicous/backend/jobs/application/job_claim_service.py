"""Hand exactly one page of work to one inference agent.

This is the single new endpoint's worth of behaviour that ADR 0003 costs. It is
deliberately small, because everything around it already exists: the queue is the
platform's ``jobs`` table, completion and failure are ``JobCallbackRequest``,
abandonment is the stale sweep, and status delivery is the existing SSE path.

One page per claim
------------------
A batch is N claims, not one claim of N pages. Work is seconds-to-minutes, so a
page in flight is a small thing to lose: a slept laptop drops one page rather
than a document, and progress is free because each page completes as it goes.
That is also why there is no heartbeat endpoint - the lease covers the work with
margin, and a heartbeat would be a second liveness mechanism for a window nothing
runs past.

Why a claimed page becomes ``waiting`` and not ``running``
----------------------------------------------------------
``waiting`` already means exactly this: an inference host holds the job and the
platform is waiting for its callback. Claiming *is* the dispatch now - there is
no second queue to POST into - so the claim writes the state the old dispatch
wrote, mints the ``inference_job_id`` the callback contract matches on, and the
whole of ``JobCallbackService`` keeps working with no change at all. ``running``
is the platform worker's own status, for jobs it executes in-process.

Two agents never receive the same page
--------------------------------------
``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` on one row, the same primitive
``claim_next_pending_job`` uses. The second claimer skips the locked row and
takes the next one, or finds nothing; it never waits on the first and never sees
the same id.

The page image arrives by signed link, not by an authenticated route
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The claim carries a link to the one page image, good for about a minute. An
authenticated ``GET /device/v1/jobs/{id}/image`` was rejected (ADR 0002): the
production API is serverless, so streaming manuscript scans through it costs
money for nothing, and it would put a route on the device credential that has to
independently re-derive job ownership. The signature *is* the authorization, and
it covers exactly one object key.

Its lifetime is not the lease's. The agent fetches once, immediately after
claiming, so the link only has to outlive one download on a bad connection;
tying it to the 600 second lease would keep a bearer token in a URL alive ten
times longer to buy nothing.
