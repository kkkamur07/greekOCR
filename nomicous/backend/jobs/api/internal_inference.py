"""Internal inference routes: job completion callbacks from an inference agent.

Completion and failure are **not** new endpoints. Since ADR 0003 there is one
inference agent, local or hosted, and it reports the way the inference service
always did: one ``JobCallbackRequest`` to this route, validated by the same
contract, applied by the same ``JobCallbackService``, announced on the same SSE
channel. The claim endpoint is the only thing that layer adds.

What did have to change is *who may present a callback*. The webhook secret is a
platform-side credential; a researcher's laptop does not have one and must not be
given one, since a shared secret handed to every agent would let any of them
complete any job on the platform. So this route also accepts the two agent
credentials, and narrows them to the page that agent is actually holding:
``jobs.claimed_by`` names the claiming device, and nothing else is accepted. A
device that merely *could* have claimed a page cannot report on it.

The webhook branch is narrowed by the same column, from the other side
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Presenting ``INFERENCE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`` used to be the end of the check: the
branch authenticated the caller and then applied the callback to whatever job id
the body named. But the only jobs that can *receive* a callback are ``waiting``
ones with a matching ``inference_job_id``, and since ADR 0003 the only writer of
that pair is ``claim_one_page`` - so every job the webhook branch could reach was
a page leased to somebody's laptop. A holder of the platform secret could
complete or fail work an agent was in the middle of.

So the branch now refuses an agent-held page. It is the exact complement of the
narrowing above, read off the same column: an agent credential may report on the
page it holds and no other, and the platform secret may report on pages no agent
holds. Today that second set is empty, which is why this reads as a guard rather
than a feature - the platform's own HTTP hop into an inference service is gone,
and ``mark_job_waiting`` is the seam a future one would come back through. It is
kept, and guarded, rather than deleted, because the secret it authenticates is
still required in production by ``backend.core.settings.ml`` and still documented
as the platform-side callback credential; deleting only the branch would leave a
mandatory secret that authenticates nothing.
