"""Opportunistic stale-job recovery for hosts that run no background worker.

``fail_stale_waiting_jobs`` and ``clear_stale_callback_claims`` only ever ran
from ``worker.process_one_job``, i.e. inside ``worker_loop``, which
``backend.core.app`` starts only when ``job_worker_enabled`` is true. The
production API deployment sets ``JOB_WORKER_ENABLED=false`` because it is
request/response only, so the inference timeout was inert exactly where jobs
were reported stuck.

``release_expired_device_leases`` joins them here rather than anywhere else for
the same reason, and it is the reason the **lease** needs no machinery of its
own: ADR 0005 promises abandonment is "the existing stale sweep", and this is it.
A background lease reaper would be a process the serverless deployment cannot
run, which is exactly the trap this module already exists to avoid.

This module runs the same sweeps from ordinary job read paths instead:

* throttled to at most one sweep per process per
  ``job_stale_sweep_min_interval_seconds`` so a hot endpoint cannot turn into a
  sweep loop;
* serialized across API replicas with ``pg_try_advisory_xact_lock`` — a replica
  that loses the race skips its turn rather than queueing, so a user request is
  never blocked waiting on another replica's sweep;
* run through ``asyncio.to_thread`` because the sweeps use sync sessions;
* never allowed to fail the request that triggered it.
