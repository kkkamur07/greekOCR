The other half - the sync claim/sweep/transition machinery that runs on

different callers; the sync half exists per ADR 0005.

        The one observable that says "something is claiming this queue". Nothing
        in the API deployment claims a pending job: the platform worker runs only
        under ``JOB_WORKER_ENABLED`` on a separate host, and ``segment`` and
        ``transcribe`` are claimed over HTTP by an inference agent. The on-read
        stale sweep reaps timeouts and never claims. So if no consumer is up,
        pending rows accumulate and every other signal stays green - see
        ``backend.core.api.health``, the only caller.

        **Every pending row counts, agent-claimed types included.** Restricting

        ``transcribe`` and ``segment`` (``document_job_enqueue``), and both are
        excluded from that claim by ``AGENT_CLAIMED_JOB_TYPES``. A number that is
        structurally always ``None`` is worse than no number.

        Measured from ``created_at`` rather than ``updated_at``: it is the queue's
        own ordering key, so ``min()`` reads the head of the
        ``ix_jobs_claim_pending`` partial index, and it cannot be reset. A page
        cycling through lease expiry (``release_expired_device_leases``) keeps its
        full age here, which is intended - a page pending for an hour is stuck
