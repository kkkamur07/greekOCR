"""Who is asking for a page of work, and which **execution target** they may take.

There is one inference agent implementation (ADR 0003) and therefore one claim
endpoint. It accepts two credentials, and the credential - not a request field -
decides the **execution target** the caller may claim:

* an ``X-Nomicous-Device-Token`` is a researcher's own computer. It claims
  ``local`` work belonging to the single account on ``helper_devices.user_id``,
  and nothing else. It can never claim ``cloud``: cloud work is platform work and
  is not scoped by that foreign key, so honouring a device token for it would
  hand one researcher's laptop every account's pages.
* an ``X-Nomicous-Service-Token`` is a hosted worker. It claims ``cloud`` work
  regardless of which account submitted it, which is the same asymmetry
  ``hosts_with_recent_devices`` already encodes: a laptop answers for its owner,
  a hosted worker answers for everyone.

The target is therefore never negotiable by the caller, and the two rules are one
line each rather than a policy object.

The service account, decided here
---------------------------------
``helper_devices.user_id`` is ``NOT NULL`` by design (ADR 0001, decision 6): that
foreign key *is* the authorization scope of a device credential, and making it
nullable to accommodate a hosted worker would delete the invariant for every
device. So a hosted worker's row needs an owner, and the owner must not be a
researcher - a researcher's account deletion cascades to their devices, their
``GET /devices`` would list platform infrastructure, and revoking it from a phone
would stop cloud inference for everyone.

The owner is therefore a **service account**: one ``users`` row that no one can
log into, addressed by a *fixed UUID5 primary key* rather than by email. Keying
on the primary key is what makes it un-hijackable - anyone can try to register an
address, nobody can choose their own uuid4. Its password is a bcrypt hash of a
discarded 256-bit secret, so no password grants it, and it holds no browser
session, no project, and no document. The only thing it owns is the
``inference_host = cloud`` device rows that report cloud **capacity**.

Those rows are provisioned on first claim rather than by hand: a hosted worker
registers itself by working, exactly as a laptop registers itself by pairing.
Provisioning takes an advisory lock so two workers starting together create one
row each rather than two rows for the same name.

same ``agent_claim_owner(device_id)`` written to ``jobs.claimed_by``. Two cloud
workers were then indistinguishable to ``job_is_held_by``, so either one could
complete or fail the page the other was running, and the claim service's promise
that "which agent holds this page is answerable from the row alone" was false for
the whole hosted fleet.
