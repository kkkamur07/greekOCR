"""How old an **inference agent** is allowed to be, and how that is decided.

ADR 0002 gives the CLI a launch moment with no in-flight work: it asks the
platform what it must be running, upgrades itself if it is too old, prints a
notice if it is merely behind, and only then starts claiming. This module is the
platform half of that exchange - the comparison itself, with no HTTP and no
settings object in it.

Two states, and collapsing them would defeat the point
------------------------------------------------------
* **Below the floor** - refused. The agent cannot claim at all until it upgrades.
  This is the thing frozen installers made impossible: stopping a known-bad
  agent from taking work without waiting for anyone to install anything.
* **Outdated** - at or above the floor but behind the latest. Served normally
  *and told*, because most upgrades are not urgent and refusing them would turn
  every release into an outage for anyone who had not restarted.

A version nobody stated is refused
----------------------------------
Missing and malformed both refuse. Treating an absent version as current would
exempt precisely the population this exists to stop: an agent old enough to
predate the header, or one whose version string we cannot compare, is not one we
can vouch for. The refusal is the same either way, and the ``reason`` tells the
CLI which it was.

Ordering is numeric, never lexicographic
----------------------------------------
``0.10.0`` is newer than ``0.9.0``, and ``"0.10.0" > "0.9.0"`` is ``False``. That
one comparison is the whole reason this is a parsed tuple rather than a string
compare, and it is what a floor of ``0.9.0`` would silently get wrong on the day
the tenth minor release shipped.

The accepted grammar
--------------------
``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``, with an optional pre-release marker (``a``/``b``/``rc``
/``dev`` plus a number) and an optional ``+local`` segment that is ignored for
ordering. A pre-release sorts *below* the release it leads to, so an agent on
``0.4.0rc1`` is below a floor of ``0.4.0`` - which is correct: a release
candidate is not the release.

That is narrower than PEP 440 on purpose. This value arrives in a header from an
unauthenticated caller, so the grammar is small enough to read in one sitting,
and anything outside it is refused rather than guessed at.
