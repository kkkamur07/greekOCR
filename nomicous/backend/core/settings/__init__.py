"""Application settings - split by concern, single .env at backend/core/.env.

Each concern keeps its own class and its own accessor: a caller that needs the
job worker's timeouts should say so by importing ``get_job_settings``, not by
reaching through an aggregate that also carries the JWT secret.

Importing this package imports all seven modules, which is what makes
:func:`reset_settings_caches` complete - it is the one supported way to discard
memoized settings after the environment changes, and it replaces enumerating the
accessors at the call site.
