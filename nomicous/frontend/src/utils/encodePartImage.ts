/**
 * Client-side payload preparation for direct-to-storage part uploads.
 *
 * The production API is serverless, and Vercel Functions cap a request body at
 * 4.5 MB - far below a manuscript page scan. Instead of POSTing the bytes through
 * the API (which would be rejected), the browser PUTs them straight to object
 * storage using a presigned URL the API minted. The API still validates and
 * re-reads dimensions on finalize, so this is an optimization that moves bytes
 * around, not a place where validation is skipped.
 *
 * Nothing on this path may lose information: the stored image is the ground truth
 * researchers annotate against. A format the browser can display natively is
 * uploaded byte-for-byte as the user provided it; anything else is decoded and
 * re-encoded as PNG, which is lossless, before upload. Lossy re-encoding is never
 * performed here - the earlier WebP-at-q0.95 step silently degraded every scan.
 *
 * The server's own hard bound is 200 MP (see ``MAX_DECODE_PIXELS``); we keep the
 * client bound tighter so a page the user can still upload is one the server will
 * accept, and so an enormous scan fails fast before a canvas allocation.
