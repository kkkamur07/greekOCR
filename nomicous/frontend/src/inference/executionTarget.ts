/**
 * How a job announces its **execution target**, and how a refused submission
 * explains itself.
 *
 * The announcement line is not cosmetic - it is the entire user interface for
 * this feature (ADR 0002). It belongs on the job rather than in a toast,
 * because a researcher who looks away must still be able to read where their
 * job went. It says which **inference host** runs the job; when the preferred
 * host had no **capacity** it says so plainly rather than substituting in
 * silence; and a failed job names the host it failed on.
 *
 * Composing the sentence is kept here, apart from any component, so the four
 * states a job can announce are one testable function rather than four pieces
 * of markup.
