# Architecture Decision Records

One file per decision, named `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`, numbered in the order the decision
was taken. A record is written when a choice is expensive to reverse: schema shape, credential
design, transport direction, trust boundaries.

Records are immutable once merged. A decision that is later reversed gets a new record that
supersedes the old one, and the old one gains a `Superseded by` line. Do not edit history. The
value of an ADR is that it says what was believed at the time, and why.
