    A crash, a killed process, or a closed laptop lid leaves a page held by an

    seconds-to-minutes, so the lease covers it with margin (ADR 0002) - and there
    is no release endpoint, because a process that was killed cannot call one.
    This sweep is the whole recovery mechanism.

    **It re-pends; it does not fail.** That is the difference from
    ``fail_stale_waiting_jobs``, and it is the point of the lease. A researcher
    who closes their lid mid-page should have that page picked up by the next
    agent, not see it permanently failed and have to resubmit. Nothing was
    dispatched to a third party, so there is no duplicate work to fear: the page
    is still exactly where it started, in the platform's own queue.

    **Except after ``max_claim_attempts`` laps.** Re-pending is right when the
    agent is why the page came back; it is a loop when the *page* is. A scan the
    model crashes on takes down every agent that claims it, so with no counter it
    cycled ``pending -> waiting -> pending`` forever: never terminal, so never
    reported to the researcher, and holding one claim slot on every lap. The
    counter lives on the row (``jobs.claim_attempts``) so this bulk statement can
    read and bump it without a per-row round trip. See ``MAX_CLAIM_ATTEMPTS``.

    The claim is cleared with it - ``claimed_by``, ``inference_job_id``,
    ``started_at``, ``heartbeat_at`` - so that *any* agent may take the page next,
    and so a woken zombie cannot report on it: the callback route matches
    ``claimed_by``, and ``JobCallbackService`` matches ``inference_job_id``.
    Neither matches once this has run.

    Concurrency is the same primitive the other sweeps use. ``FOR UPDATE SKIP
    LOCKED`` in the same transaction as the update means a second sweeper skips
    rows already being released rather than releasing them twice, and the

    over HTTP and call this to record that it was out for dispatch. ADR 0003
    deleted that hop. Since then the only writer of ``waiting`` is

    dispatch comes back through, and because the deletion does not stop here: the

    the result is ``INFERENCE_WEBHOOK_SECRET``, required in production by
    ``backend.core.settings.ml`` and documented as such in ``docs/deployment``.
    Removing the two functions and leaving a mandatory setting and a mandatory
    secret behind them would be a worse lie than this docstring.
