"""Wire shapes for the claim endpoint.

The claimed page carries an instruction, not a payload. It used to carry a whole
``nomikos_inference.contracts.jobs.JobSubmitRequest`` - the body the platform once POSTed
into a second inference queue - so that local and cloud agents took literally the
same object. Since ADR 0003 there is no second queue and no POST: the agent
claims from the platform's own table and fetches the scan from the signed link in
this same response. What reusing the submit contract bought was one field,
``image_bytes``, which no agent has ever read and which base64-encoded a whole
manuscript page into every claim at about 1.33x its stored size.

So the claim has its own shape, holding exactly the fields the agent reads. The
submit contract stays where it belongs, describing a submission.
