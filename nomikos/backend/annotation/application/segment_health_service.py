"""Offer kraken's systematic fixes to a reviewer, and apply the one they pick.

`segment_health` is pure geometry and knows nothing about the database. This is
the layer between it and a page: it reads the part's lines, measures the page,
asks for the three kinds of fix, and writes back exactly the one a human chose.

Two rules shape the whole module.

**The server recomputes the geometry; the client only names a choice.** An apply
request carries line ids and an operation, never a polygon. The fix is derived
again from the rows as they are at that moment and refused if it is no longer on
offer. A client that has been open in a tab since before someone else edited the
page therefore cannot write geometry measured against a page that no longer
exists, which is the failure a "here are the points, save them" endpoint invites.

**Nothing that carries human work is destroyed.** A merge keeps the primary
row's id so its transcription and pairing survive. A delete refuses on any line
with text or a pairing. A pairing is read from ``page_transcription_lines``, not
inferred from the transcription layers, because the two can disagree: see
``_is_paired``. Geometry this module writes is marked
``manual_geometry`` so a later re-segment treats it as a human's work rather
than kraken's, which is the flag re-segmentation reads before it clears a page.

Both destructive paths re-check the has-someone-worked-on-this rule that
`segment_health` already applied when it decided what to offer. Those second checks are backstops, not
the live defence: as the finders stand today neither can fire, because a
fragment or suspect carrying text is never offered in the first place. They are
here so that relaxing a *flagging* rule cannot silently become permission to
delete, and each says so at the point it is written.
