"""Which **execution target**s a model permits.

**Host eligibility** lives in the **Registry** (``registry.yaml``), keyed by
**registry model id**. This module is the one place that turns it into the set of
targets a job may choose. It *constrains*; it never chooses - that is
:func:`backend.ml.domain.execution.choose_execution_target`.

The mapping is deliberately asymmetric, and follows the glossary wording:

* ``remote`` - "only on a hosted server". Not a **lite model tier**, so ``local``
  is out.
* ``local`` - "may run on the researcher's machine". A **lite model tier** is
  sized for a laptop CPU; a hosted worker runs the same package on a bigger
  machine, so it can run one too. Both targets stay open.
* ``any`` - either.

An id the Registry does not know is treated as ``remote``. We cannot show it is
laptop-sized, and "not demonstrably lite" is the honest reading of the rule -
the alternative silently ships an unknown model to a researcher's CPU.

# There are three transcribe models now (Greek, Armenian, Syriac) and no reason
# to think a job carrying no catalog model wants the Syriac one. The entry stays
# unchanged anyway, because what this module asks of it is narrower than it
# looks: the id is handed to `host_eligibility_for`, and all three Calamari
# entries are `local`, so every candidate answers that question identically.
# Naming a different script here would change no behaviour and would still be a
# guess.
#
# The guess that does matter, which weights transcribe a page whose job named no
# model, is not fixable by editing this line: any single default is wrong for two
# of the three scripts. That belongs upstream, in making the caller carry a
# catalog model. Dropping the key would be the quiet change, not the honest one:
# `registry_model_id_for` would return None, unknown reads as `remote` by design,
# and model-less transcribe jobs would stop being eligible for a researcher's
# laptop without anything saying so.
