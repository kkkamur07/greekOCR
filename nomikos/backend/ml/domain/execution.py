"""Execution target and capacity - the two words submission is decided in.

**Execution target** is the **inference host** one job runs on, ``local`` or
``cloud``. It is fixed when the job is submitted and never changed afterwards,
which is the property every other decision in ADR 0002 rests on: a job never
silently moves host, and a job never waits on a machine that is not there.

**Capacity** is whether an inference host currently has a machine able to take
work. A researcher's laptop and a hosted worker are the same kind of thing here,
so there is one question with one answer rather than two - the answer comes from
:mod:`backend.ml.application.capacity_service`, which reads recent device
activity.

Three inputs decide one target, and they are deliberately different in kind:

* **preference** - the account-level setting, "use my computer when it is
  available". There is no per-job toggle: a researcher cannot know which host is
  faster for a given page, so asking at every action is a decision without a
  basis.
* **eligibility** - what the chosen model permits. **Host eligibility**
  *constrains* which targets a job may choose; it does not choose one.
* **capacity** - which hosts can actually take work right now.

There is no cloud-fallback timer, no hold window, and no sweeper for unclaimed
local jobs. The decision is made once, before the job exists, and when neither
host can take the work submission refuses rather than creating a job nobody will
claim.

``local_only`` is deliberately absent. Its justification - manuscripts never
leave the machine - was never true, since page images already live in the
platform's media store and the browser downloads them from there; and it was the
one mode that could leave a job with no terminal outcome. See ADR 0002.
