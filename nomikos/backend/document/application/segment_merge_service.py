"""Segment merge - replace the machine geometry nobody has touched, keep everything a human did.

A segment job redraws a page. What it must never do is throw away work: ``manual_geometry``
records that someone moved a polygon, but that is only one of the ways a human touches a
line. Approving its text writes a ground-truth transcription; pairing it with a line of
imported page text writes a ``page_transcription_lines`` row. Neither sets
``manual_geometry``, so a page where forty lines were corrected and approved without a
single polygon being nudged looks, to a geometry-only guard, exactly like a page nobody
has opened. The guard here is the union of the three signals: a line survives a re-segment
if it has manual geometry, **or** approved text, **or** a pairing.

Keeping a line is half of it. The segmenter does not know the line was kept and draws the
same ink again, so a fully approved page would come back with every approved line sitting
under a near-identical fresh twin. A fresh line whose polygon is mostly inside the kept
lines is therefore not added: what it covers is already claimed.
