"""The document's transcription as plain text, page after page.

Neither of the other two document exports serves the reader who wants the words and
nothing else - to paste into an edition, to diff against a printed text, to feed a
concordance. The PDF is a picture of a page and the PAGE XML is geometry; this is the
same ground-truth text both of them carry, in reading order.

Each page opens with a ``[p.N]`` marker and pages are separated by a blank line, so a
line found here can be traced back to the page it came off without opening the document.
``N`` is the page's position in the whole document, not its position in the export: a
``reviewed_only`` run that covers pages 2 and 5 says 2 and 5.
