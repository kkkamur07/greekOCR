"""The documents in a project: their existence, their names, and their workflow state.

One responsibility: a document's life from creation to deletion, plus the reads that
expose it. Page images, geometry and transcription text are three other modules; this one
only ever touches the ``documents`` and ``transcriptions`` rows.

The public (unauthenticated) reads live here rather than in a separate "public service"
because they are the *same* lifecycle reads with a different audience, and the audience is
already a parameter of :class:`DocumentAccess`. Splitting them apart would put the
published-workflow rule in two places again.
