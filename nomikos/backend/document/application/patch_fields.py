"""Which fields each PATCH accepts, and what happens when a caller sends another.

The handlers apply ``model_dump(exclude_unset=True)`` verbatim with ``setattr``, which is
what makes an explicit ``null`` distinguishable from an omitted field. That same
verbatim application is why an unrecognised key has to be refused loudly rather than
dropped: silently ignoring it would let a client believe it had written something.

Over HTTP that refusal is also enforced by the request models themselves
(``extra="forbid"`` on ``DocumentUpdateRequest``, ``BlockPatchRequest`` and
``LinePatchRequest``), which answers 422.

The guard here stays for callers that build the dict themselves - the service methods take
``**updates`` and are reachable from scripts and tests - and as a safety net should a
schema ever gain a field this list does not know about.
