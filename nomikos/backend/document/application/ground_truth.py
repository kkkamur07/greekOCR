"""Writing ground-truth text onto a line.

Three use cases converge here: the bulk line replace, page-transcription pairing, and
editing a ground-truth line directly. All three need the same two invariants held:

* a document has exactly **one** ground-truth layer, created on first write rather than
  by migration, because documents predate the layer and a document created through the
  repository already carries one;
* ``text=None`` *removes* the line's ground-truth row rather than storing an empty
  string, and any write clears ``confidence``. A confidence score is a claim the model
  made; once a human has supplied the text there is nothing left for it to describe.

Kept out of the modules that use it precisely because all three need it: this is the one
piece of shared behaviour that survived breaking up ``DocumentService``, and it is shared
by injection rather than by inheritance.
