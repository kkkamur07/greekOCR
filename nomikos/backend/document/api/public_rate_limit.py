"""Per-client ceilings on the unauthenticated read surface.

The thumbnail route was the only public route that metered anything, and it is the
cheapest one on the surface: a decode plus a resize, served from a render cache. The
expensive ones - a reportlab render of a whole page, a PAGE XML export, a layout read
that joins lines to their transcriptions - answered anonymous callers as fast as they
could be asked. Any of them is a better lever on the process than the one route that
was guarded.

Where the address does not identify one client, nothing is charged. That is the same
answer the thumbnail throttle already gave, and the reason is worth keeping in front of
whoever changes this: behind a proxy tier the deployment cannot allowlist, every visitor
shares the peer address, so a bucket keyed on it is a single global bucket. Filling it is
then an outage for every reader at once, which is a worse outcome than the flood it was
meant to stop. The bounds that still hold in that case are the page size on the layout
read and the render cache on the thumbnail.
