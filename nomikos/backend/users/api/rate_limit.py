"""Postgres-backed rate limiter for sensitive and unauthenticated endpoints.

Each attempt is recorded as a row in ``auth_rate_limit_attempts``. Because the
store lives in the shared database, the limit is enforced uniformly across all
uvicorn worker processes and across serverless invocations - an in-process dict
would silently divide the effective limit by the number of workers, or reset on
every cold start.

Choosing the key is the harder half of the problem. ``request.client.host`` is
the direct TCP peer, which on a managed platform is the provider's proxy rather
than the browser. Keying a "per-client" limit on that value produces one global
bucket: it throttles the whole product instead of the attacker. So the peer is
only used when the deployment declares it meaningful (see
``AppSettings.trust_peer_ip``), and sensitive auth routes carry a second,
independent bucket keyed on the account being targeted - which is correct no
matter what the network path looks like.

That second bucket only holds if the account is read out of every request that
could reach a password check, so nothing about how the client *describes* its
body is allowed to decide whether the body gets read. See
``_request_account_identity``.

The two dimensions are also charged at different moments, which is the other
half of getting the account bucket right - see ``throttle_auth_attempts``.
