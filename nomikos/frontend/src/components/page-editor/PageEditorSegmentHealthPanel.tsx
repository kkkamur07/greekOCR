/**
 * The three mistakes kraken makes on a page, offered one at a time.
 *
 * Nothing here applies anything on its own. Each finding is a row with the fix
 * spelled out and a button next to it, because the whole point of the feature
 * is that a human decides. Suspects go further and carry no one-click action at
 * all: they are things that *look* like noise, some of which is real ink nobody
 * has transcribed yet, so the row states the reasons and asks for a second
 * click before it will delete anything.
