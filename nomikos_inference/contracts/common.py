    ``polygon_white`` is the recipe in
    ``src/preprocessing_data/syriac/xml_to_data.py::crop_polygon``: the polygon's
    bounding box, widened by the model's ``line_crop_padding`` and clamped to the
    page, with every pixel outside the polygon painted white on the crop.

    Every registry model uses it. What differs between them is the padding, not
    the function, which is why that lives in its own registry field rather than
    in another enum value here. Measured 2026-09-07 on the pages each model was
    trained on, same ONNX in every run:

    * ``greek-calamari-v1`` on the whole Grec1360 corpus (204 lines) reads 0/204
      exact at padding 12 (CER 0.304) and 125/204 exact at padding 0 (CER 0.050).
      Its finetuning crops were exported with no padding.
    * ``armenian-calamari-v1`` on the full MS_UCLA_MS document reads 664/819
      exact at padding 12.

    The enum stays a single-value enum rather than collapsing to a bool because
    the field then still names the convention, and a second convention (should a
    future model arrive with one) is an added member rather than a schema change.
