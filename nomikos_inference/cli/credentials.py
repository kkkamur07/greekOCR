"""Where the device token lives on a researcher's machine, and who may read it.

ADR 0001: a long-lived credential now sits on a laptop where none existed
before, and whoever can read it can claim that researcher's `local` work until
the device is revoked. The control this layer owns is the mode bits (`0600` in
a `0700` directory), so another account on a shared machine cannot claim jobs
as them. Everything else (per-user scope, revocation on the next call) is
enforced by the platform.

The file is written through a temp file in the same directory, flushed and
`fsync`ed, then renamed, so an interrupted write leaves the previous credential
intact rather than a truncated one. That promise only covers a killed process,
not a lost power supply: `os.replace` orders the rename against the file's
metadata, so a rename that reaches disk before the bytes do leaves a
zero-length `device.json`, which reads as a corrupt credential rather than an
unpaired machine. `os.open` with `0o600` alone isn't enough either, since the
process umask is subtracted from that mode, hence the `fchmod` that follows it.
