"""Cut one line out of a page the way that model's training crops were cut.

There is one crop function, ``crop_polygon`` in
``src/preprocessing_data/syriac/xml_to_data.py`` (Armenian reaches it through
``src/preprocessing_data/armenian.py``), and every registry model was trained on
its output: the polygon's bounding box, widened by a padding and clamped to the
page, with every pixel outside the polygon painted white on the crop, then
``convert("L")``. What differs between models is only that padding, which is why
the registry declares it per model rather than this file assuming one. The Greek
finetuning crops were exported with 0 px and the Armenian and Syriac ones with
12; feeding Greek the Armenian padding costs it 125 exact lines out of 204 down
to 0 (CER 0.050 to 0.304) on its own corpus.

Serving has to cut the same picture the model was shown, or it reads a line it
was never trained for. ``cv2.fillPoly`` is kept rather than swapped for
``ImageDraw.polygon`` because the two rasterise polygon edges differently, and a
one-pixel disagreement along every edge is exactly the kind of skew this file
exists to prevent.

The array this module returns is not yet the picture the model saw. The training
exporter wrote each crop through ``save_crop`` as a grayscale JPEG at
``quality=82, optimize=True`` and the trainer's loader read that file back, so
the model was fitted on pixels that had been through a lossy round trip. The
runner re-encodes the same way before handing the crop on; see
``nomikos_inference/jobs/runner.py::_crop_line_image``.

Parity with the training function is asserted by
``tests/inference/unit/test_calamari_training_parity.py``.
