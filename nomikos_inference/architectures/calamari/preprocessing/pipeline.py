"""Calamari line preprocessing for the ONNX inference runtime.

**Serving must reproduce the training loader exactly.** The models in the
registry were trained by ``src/models/calamari/trainer.py`` through
``src/models/calamari/data.py::_load_line_image``, which does precisely three
things to a line crop:

1. ``Image.convert("L")``,
2. an aspect-preserving resize to the model's line height with
   ``Image.Resampling.BILINEAR`` (``width = max(1, round(w * h_target / h))``),
3. a transpose to ``time x height`` with the raw ``uint8`` values kept as they
   are (the graph divides by 255 itself).

Dark ink on a light background, never inverted, never dewarped, never padded.
This module is that recipe and nothing more. Until 2026-09-07 it mirrored the
legacy TensorFlow Calamari processors instead (centre-line dewarping, inversion
to white-on-black, a 16 px zero pad), which no registry model was ever trained
on; on Armenian training pages that produced 1 exact line in 30 where the
training recipe produces 30 in 30 on the same ``best.onnx``. See ADR 0007.

If the trainer's loader changes, this file changes with it, and
``tests/inference/unit/test_calamari_training_parity.py`` is what says so.
