"""Refine raw PP-OCRv6 detection quads into clean manuscript lines.

Pipeline order inside the adapter: detect quads, merge row fragments,
resolve overlaps, classify suspects, order, build the response. Everything
here is pure geometry relative to the page's own medians and the column
bands that ``reading_order`` builds; no absolute pixel threshold transfers
between manuscripts. Overlap is shared area divided by the smaller
polygon's area: 5 to 7 percent is normal (ascenders, descenders), 20
percent or more is treated as a defect.
