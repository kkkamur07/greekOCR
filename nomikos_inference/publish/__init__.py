"""Publish checkpoints and datasets to the Hugging Face Hub.

Runtime `hf://` resolution does not live here: it is `nomikos_inference.hub`
(ADR 0002), because it is on the inference path and a runtime that cannot fetch
its own weights is not a runtime. What lives here is publish-side and
repository-relative: the **Hub staging tree**, **Local bundled weights**, model
cards, and collection sync, none of which a researcher ever installs.

The directory sits inside `nomikos_inference/` so that it imports like
everything else in this repository, and it is named in the `exclude` list of
both build targets in `pyproject.toml` so that it still ships to nobody. Being
inside the package directory and being inside the wheel are two different
things, and the boundary ADR 0002 drew is the second one.
