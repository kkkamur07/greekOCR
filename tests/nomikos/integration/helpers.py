Nothing here imports the backend at module scope. ``conftest.py`` sets the
environment the settings objects read *before* it imports ``backend.core.app``,
and it imports this module for the service-token constant, so a top-level
backend import here would be resolved too early. The backend imports are inside
the functions that need them, deliberately.
