"""``process_one_job``'s stale sweeps, against live Postgres.

The unit test that used to stand in for this file patched four of the five
repository calls and asserted the *order* they were made in. That is a test of
the call list, not of recovery: every sweep's actual population is decided by a
``WHERE`` clause, and a mocked sweep has no ``WHERE`` clause. It also left one
call unpatched, so it opened a real connection from the unit lane - which has no
database - and was red. The ordering assertion it was reaching for is cheap and
now lives in ``tests/nomikos/unit/test_job_lifecycle.py`` with **all five**
calls patched; the recovery behaviour lives here, where there are rows.

**Expiry is created by writing the timestamp, not by waiting for it.** Same rule
as ``test_device_lease.py``: the shortest deadline in play is 240 seconds, so a
test that waited for one is a test nobody runs, and a patched clock would prove
something about the patch rather than about the SQL Postgres executes.

**Every row here is a ``segment`` job.** No sweep filters on type, and
``claim_next_pending_job`` skips the agent-claimed types (ADR 0003), so the
lifespan worker - which is always running and polls every 250 ms - cannot claim
a row this test just re-pended and race the assertion about it. The one thing
type controls is the claim, and the claim is not what is under test.
