"""**Execution target** and **capacity** gating, over HTTP against live Postgres.

Everything here goes through the real ``create_app()`` and the real database.
ADR 0001 records why that is not negotiable: an earlier device layer was never
mounted, and the integration suite hid it by building its own FastAPI app in the
test file - an entire phase unreachable behind a green suite. So there is no
local app here, and no substitute for Postgres.

**Capacity is time-dependent, and it is controlled here by writing
``last_seen_at``**, not by patching a clock. That is the actual production
signal: a host has capacity when one of its devices was seen inside
``DEVICE_IDLE_WINDOW_SECONDS``. A test that froze time would prove the freezing
worked; a test that writes a timestamp proves the query does.

The four submission outcomes, which are the whole of this issue:

1. the preferred host has capacity - the job goes there and says so;
2. the preferred host does not and the other does - the job goes to the other
   *and says so*, never silently, and says so **in the enqueue response itself**:
   the target is fixed at submission, so it is announced at submission, not on
   the first status update (issue 64);
3. neither has capacity - submission is refused with a reason, rather than
   creating a job nobody will claim;
4. a submitted job's target cannot be changed - not through the mapper, and not
   through raw SQL either.
