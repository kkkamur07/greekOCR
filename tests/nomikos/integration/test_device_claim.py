"""The claim endpoint, over HTTP, against the real app and live Postgres.

Everything here goes through ``create_app()``. ADR 0001 records why that is not
negotiable: an earlier device layer was never mounted, and the integration suite
hid it by building its own FastAPI app - a whole phase unreachable behind a green
suite. So there is no local app in this file, no substitute for Postgres, and the
device credential is minted by running the real pairing protocol rather than by
writing a row.

There are no assertions about how long a long poll takes. The contract is what a
claim returns and to whom; the clock is not part of it, and an assertion on it
would fail for reasons that are not defects.

    """The platform secret authenticates the platform, not a claim on this page.

    This used to return 204 and mark the job done. The webhook branch checked the
    secret and nothing else, so a holder of INFERENCE_WEBHOOK_SECRET could
    complete or fail a page a researcher's laptop was in the middle of running -
    discarding that run, and leaving the agent's own callback to be rejected as a
    duplicate. The agent credentials are narrowed to the page they hold; this one
    is now narrowed to the pages no agent holds.

    The credential has to be a genuinely valid one, and this test has to be able
    to say so. It used to send the string literal from the conftest default,
    which is only the configured secret while nobody has
    ``INFERENCE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`` exported already - ``setdefault`` yields to an
    existing value. With one exported, the header became a *wrong* secret, which
    the endpoint also refuses with 403, and whose detail the error handler
    redacts to the same "Access denied" body. The test stayed green while proving
    only that bad credentials are rejected, which is a different test's job.

    So the secret is read from settings rather than retyped, and the probe below
    shows the credential really is accepted before the leased page refuses it.
