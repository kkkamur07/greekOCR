"""Document-level batch actions, over HTTP against live Postgres.

The unit of work in this platform is one page, and that does not change here: a batch
action is a fan-out that decides *which* pages, then hands each one to the same per-part
enqueue service. So what these tests hold to account is the deciding, not the enqueuing:

* the additive scopes really do skip the pages that already have the work done, because
  that is the only thing standing between "segment the pages that need it" and losing a
  chapter's transcriptions;
* the counts the menu renders match, exactly, what the corresponding scope would queue -
  a label that says 12 and an action that queues 9 is worse than no label;
* a batch with nothing to do succeeds rather than erroring, on an empty document and on
  a finished one alike;
* no capacity refuses the whole batch before the first job, so a chapter is never left
  half queued.

Segment and transcribe jobs stay ``pending`` throughout: the platform worker leaves
inference job types for an agent to claim over HTTP, and no agent runs in this suite.
That is what lets these tests read job rows straight out of Postgres.
