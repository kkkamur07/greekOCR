"""Segment health against Postgres: the two statements a fake cannot check.

The service's unit tests hand it a fake repository, so they prove it *asks* for
the pairings and takes the part lock, and nothing at all about whether the SQL
underneath returns the right rows. Both queries are new, and between them they
decide whether a line may be deleted, so they are checked here against the real
database rather than against a stub that returns whatever the test set.
