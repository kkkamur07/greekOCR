"""The migration chain must reproduce ``Base.metadata`` exactly.

This is the ``alembic check`` the project was missing. 001_initial_schema used to
build the baseline with ``Base.metadata.create_all``, which made a missing
migration structurally undetectable: a fresh database migrated to head always
matched the ORM because head *was* the ORM. The revisions that had to be written
afterwards to add ``jobs.claimed_by`` and ``document_parts.width`` are what that
cost us - schema changes that reached production before anyone noticed they had
no migration. They are folded back into the baseline now, but only because this
test exists to catch the next one.

So this test migrates a *scratch* database from empty to head and asserts that
alembic's autogenerate comparison against ``Base.metadata`` finds nothing. Add a
column to an ORM model without a migration and this goes red.

The scratch database is created and dropped per run rather than reusing the test
database: the point is to exercise the chain from nothing, and running it against
the shared database would collide with every other integration test.
