"""`nomikos run`, the **claim** loop, driven as the installed console script.

Everything here is live, and on this issue that is not a stylistic preference.
Every claim the run loop makes is about behaviour *between* processes: that a
page is claimed over HTTP and reported back over HTTP, that exactly one is in
flight at a time, that a Ctrl-C delivered to a real process ends the page it was
holding. None of that is observable from inside one interpreter, and a test that
imported `inference.cli.run` and called it would be asserting about its own
mocks.

So: the CLI is the real `nomikos` executable from a real wheel with its real
dependency closure installed, the platform is a real uvicorn process serving the
real `create_app()`, the database is real Postgres migrated by alembic, and the
models are the real **Hub artifact**s - ONNX graphs under ADR 0006, resolved
through the **Hub cache** exactly as a researcher's laptop resolves them.

Most of what is here is a platform invariant - credentials, signals, exit codes -
rather than anything about a model, and those tests run against a **Registry**
whose weights are not on this machine: a page travels the whole loop and ends
`failed` instead of `done`, which costs nothing and keeps the invariant in the
pull-request lane. The three `ml`-marked tests are the ones where the weights
are doing real work: two compare what the model produced, and
`test_only_one_page_is_ever_in_flight` needs a page to take long enough that
"one row says `waiting`" still means "the agent holds one page" - see its
docstring.

The scaffolding all three CLI integration modules share - Postgres, alembic,
uvicorn, the wheel build, the hand-rolled HTTP client - is in
`tests/inference/integration/conftest.py`. This module keeps its own database
rather than the one `tests/nomikos/integration/conftest.py` truncates between
tests, so a server held open across it cannot have the ground moved under it.

    loop ever claimed ahead, this would see two.

    Keeps its `ml` marker, and the real model run is load-bearing for the
    *observation* rather than for the claim. This test infers "the agent holds
    one page" from "one row says `waiting`", and those two are the same statement
