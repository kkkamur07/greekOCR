"""The published `nomikos-inference` package, exercised as an installed wheel.

Everything here runs against a real wheel installed into a real, empty virtual
environment, in a subprocess whose working directory is outside the repository.
That last detail is the whole point: run this from the repository root with the
tree importable and every assertion would pass whether or not the package
boundary exists. The subprocess proves it does.

Marked `ml` because it downloads a dependency closure and real **Hub
artifact**s, and runs both architectures on a real page - minutes, not seconds.

#   script exists in their `installed_cli` fixtures and then *run* it, and

#   keeps the `0+unknown` guard in the lane that runs on every pull request rather than
#   behind this module's `ml` marker.
# * `test_the_installed_closure_carries_no_torch_and_no_accelerator_wheels` was a strict
#   subset of `test_every_target_platform_resolves_without_an_accelerator_wheel` below,
#   which asserts the same three properties across five target platforms instead of one.
# * `test_the_installed_package_holds_no_web_server` asserted `find_spec` returns `None`
#   for `inference.api` and `inference.helper`, two modules #60 deleted; asking whether a
#   module that does not exist can be found is not a guard. Its `fastapi`/`uvicorn`/
