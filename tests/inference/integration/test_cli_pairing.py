"""`nomicous pair` and `nomicous version`, run as the installed console script.

Everything here is live. The CLI is the real `nomicous` executable from a real
wheel in its own virtual environment; the platform is a real uvicorn process
serving the real `create_app()`; the database is real Postgres, migrated by
alembic. Nothing is patched, faked, or substituted - the approval that unblocks
each pairing is an HTTP request from a second process, exactly as a browser
would make it.

That matters more here than it usually would. Every claim this issue makes is
about behaviour *between* processes: that the URL is printed before a browser is
launched, that the code the terminal shows is the code the consent screen shows,
that the credential lands on disk readable by nobody else. A test that imported
`inference.cli.pair` and called it could not observe any of them.

The scaffolding all three CLI integration modules share - Postgres, alembic,
uvicorn, the wheel build, the hand-rolled HTTP client - is in
`tests/inference/integration/conftest.py`. This module keeps its own database
(`kalamos_056_cli`) rather than the one `tests/nomicous/integration/conftest.py`
truncates between tests, so a server held open across it cannot have the ground
moved under it.
