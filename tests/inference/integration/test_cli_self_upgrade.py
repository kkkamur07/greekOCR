"""`nomicous upgrade` - the launch check - against a real index and a real platform.

Everything here is live, and the package index is the part that had to be. The
agent is a real `nomicous` console script installed from a real wheel; the index
it upgrades from is a PEP 503 tree of real wheels served over real HTTP by
`python -m http.server`; the installer is the real `pip` or the real `uv`,
resolving over the network to that index; and the platform is a real uvicorn
process serving the real `create_app()` against real Postgres. The re-exec is a
real `execve`, observed by reading the version off the process that came out the
other side.

That matters because every claim this issue makes is about what happens *between*
processes. "Upgrades, re-execs, and then claims" is three processes and two
network services; a test that patched `subprocess.run` would be asserting that
this module knows what it wrote, and would have proved nothing about whether a
researcher's laptop comes back up on the new build.

Two things about the wheels are deliberately unlike production, and neither is a
substitution for anything under test. They are built from the repository's own
`inference/` tree with a generated `pyproject.toml`, because two versions of one
package cannot both be the checked-in version - the *code* in them is this
repository's. And they declare no dependencies, so the resolver never leaves the
local index; whether the published closure resolves is
`test_published_package.py`'s question, and answering it here would download the
whole thing twice per test.

The scaffolding all three CLI integration modules share - Postgres, alembic,
uvicorn, the hand-rolled HTTP client - is in
`tests/inference/integration/conftest.py`. This module keeps its own database
(`kalamos_058_upgrade`) for the same reason `test_cli_pairing.py` does: servers
are held open across it.

# `test_an_environment_with_no_pip_upgrades_with_uv` stood here. Every other test in this
# file installs with `agent_at(...)` and no `with_pip`, i.e. the uv branch, and asserts the
# upgrade landed - so the uv path is the one this module exercises by default. The pip
# variant above is the branch nothing else covers, and it stays.


# `test_the_floor_is_asked_once_per_launch` and `test_commands_that_do_not_claim_never_ask_
# the_floor` stood here. Both counted requests off the uvicorn access log to pin a call
# count, which is an implementation detail rather than a behaviour a researcher can
# observe; the second did not test what its docstring claimed, exercising `version` and
# `--help` but never `pair`. Cutting them retired `Platform.requests_to`, the `FLOOR_PATH`
# constant, and the `--log-level info` this module's servers only needed so that log would
# be written.


# `test_asking_for_the_floor_takes_nothing_from_the_queue` and
# `test_an_agent_that_states_no_version_is_refused_by_the_floor_endpoint` stood here. Both
# were raw `urllib` calls against a platform endpoint with no CLI involved at all, and the
# second was a verbatim duplicate of `tests/nomicous/integration/test_agent_version_floor.py::
# test_an_agent_that_does_not_say_what_it_is_is_refused`. That module owns this surface and
# covers it in fifteen tests.
