"""The claim loop survives a bad hop, and a finished page is never thrown away.

Three failures with the same shape: something transient happened at the wrong
moment, and the agent treated it as final.

**A single failed claim ended the loop.** `_claim_loop` caught `KeyboardInterrupt`
and nothing else, and `PlatformError` covers every `URLError`, `TimeoutError`,
and non-200 on that path - so one 502 from a gateway being restarted stopped an
agent that `--exit-when-empty`'s own help text promises "keeps running" without
it. A researcher who left a laptop claiming overnight came back to a dead
process and a full queue.

**A Ctrl-C between running a page and reporting it lost the page.** `_handle_page`
computed `output` inside its `try`, then left it to print timing and call
`_report`. An interrupt in that window escaped to `_claim_loop`, which has no
access to `output` and reports `status="failed"` - terminal. The page died with
the transcription already computed, one stack frame away.

**A failed report discarded the work.** One `PlatformError` posting the terminal
callback was printed and dropped, so a transcribed page waited for its **lease**
to expire and went back to the queue to be run again.

These are unit tests over the loop's own functions with a stub client. The real
loop against a real platform is `tests/inference/integration/test_cli_run.py`,
which needs Postgres; this file needs nothing, so the guarantees are checked on
every run of the unit lane.
