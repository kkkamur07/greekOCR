"""Serving must build the exact picture the Calamari models were trained on.

Every Calamari model in ``nomikos_inference/registry.yaml`` was cut by
``src/preprocessing_data/syriac/xml_to_data.py::crop_polygon``, written to disk
by that file's ``save_crop``, and loaded during training by
``src/models/calamari/data.py::_load_line_image``. Serving has three chances to
disagree with that, and until 2026-09-07 it took all three: it cut a bare
bounding box rather than the masked polygon, it ran the legacy TensorFlow
Calamari processors (invert, centre-line dewarp, 16 px pad) instead of the
trainer's three-step resize, and it never had a padding to cut at. None of the
three shows up as an exception; all three show up as a model that reads a
manuscript worse than its own validation numbers say it can.

So these tests do not restate the recipe in a second implementation, which could
only ever drift alongside the first. They import the **real training code** and
assert the serving output is byte-identical to it. No weights and no ``ml``
marker: this has to run in the default job, because the default job is where a
preprocessing change lands.

One crop function serves all three models. What is per model is the padding it
was exported with: Greek used 0 and the other two used 12, so the crop parity
test runs at both and the second half of this file covers the registry fields
that carry the number.
