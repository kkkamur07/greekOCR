"""Focused tests for the BLLA preprocessing, decoder and runner path.

The graph itself, and the Kraken-oracle comparisons that used it, moved to
``tests/export`` with the Torch modules under ADR 0006. What is left here is
what a researcher's install actually contains: NumPy preprocessing, the
Torch-free decoder, and the runner that ties them to the ONNX session.

    It was 8 while it only had to keep an extreme panorama from allocating a
    multi-gigabyte array. Under ADR 0006 it also bounds how far the ONNX graph
    may drift from the Torch oracle, because the scaled width is the free axis
    and the disagreement grows with it - roughly linearly in the RMS, from
    1.7e-05 on a real 2471-wide page to 1.9e-04 at 14400. Logits crossing the
    0.5 boundary, which the decoder is discontinuous at, go from none below 5400
    to a handful at every width from 7200 up.

    Three keeps the drift within a factor of three of the page ADR 0006
    validated and still leaves every codex shape untouched: a single leaf is
    near 0.7:1 and a two-page spread reaches about 2.5:1. What it costs is
    horizontal resolution on a stitched scroll, which is squeezed by up to 2.67x
    where 8:1 used to pass through.

    ``tests/export/test_blla_onnx.py`` holds the numeric half of this claim

    install can check.
