"""The ONNX Runtime contract, exercised on real weights (ADR 0006).

Everything here runs a real graph. The rules under test are the ones ADR 0006
makes load-bearing and that nothing else pins:

* both architectures execute through ONNX Runtime on CPU,
* the artifact carries its own codec, so nothing but the ``.onnx`` is needed,
* the **artifact SHA-256** is verified *before* the artifact is opened,
* a retired native checkpoint sitting in the same directory is refused rather
  than loaded,
* the outputs are deterministic run to run, so a local result and a cloud
  worker result are comparable.

No stubbed sessions: a test that cannot run a real graph does not belong in
this file. Nothing here imports Torch - that is the point of the split, and
``test_architecture_contract`` asserts it of the package rather than of this
module.
