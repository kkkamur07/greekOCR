"""Choosing one **execution target** from preference, eligibility, and **capacity**.

Everything here runs the real code on real values - there is nothing to fake,
because the decision was deliberately built as a pure function of three inputs.
Where those inputs come from (device rows, the Registry, the account setting) is
exercised against live Postgres in
``tests/nomicous/integration/test_execution_target.py``.

What is pinned:

* **preference first, then the other host, and nothing else.** No scoring, no
  queue depth. A second host is tried only because the first cannot take work.
* **substitution is recorded, not swallowed.** The decision carries the host the
  researcher asked for as well as the one they got, because announcing the
  downgrade *is* the feature (ADR 0002).
* **refusal has a reason.** Both refusals name their situation: "nothing is
  running" and "nothing this model can run on is running" are different problems
  with different fixes.
* **eligibility constrains, it does not choose.** A model that is not a **lite
  model tier** cannot be sent to a laptop even when the laptop is the preference
  and the laptop is available.

Also asserted: ``local_only`` is not a member of the enum. It is the one thing a
future reader is most likely to add back, and the reason it is gone is a decision
(ADR 0002), not an oversight.
