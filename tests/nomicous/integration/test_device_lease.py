"""The device **lease**, end to end, against live Postgres and the real app.

Everything here goes through ``create_app()``. ADR 0001 records why that is not
negotiable: an earlier device layer was never mounted and the integration suite
hid it behind its own FastAPI app. So there is no local app in this file, no
substitute for Postgres, and the device credentials are minted by running the
real pairing protocol.

**Expiry is created by writing the timestamp, not by waiting for it.** The lease
is 600 seconds; a test that slept through one is a test nobody runs, and a
patched clock would prove something about the patch rather than about the SQL
that Postgres will actually execute in production. So the row's ``updated_at`` is
aged in the database and the real sweep is then asked what it makes of it.

The one thing this file exists to prove: an expired lease sends the page **back
to the queue**, not to ``failed``. ADR 0005 made a claimed page ``waiting`` so
``JobCallbackService`` needed no change, which quietly put a researcher's laptop
under the 240-second waiting timeout - a timeout that *fails* the job. A closed
lid is not a failed job.
