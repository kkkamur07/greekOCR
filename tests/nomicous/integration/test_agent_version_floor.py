"""The version floor over HTTP, against the real app and live Postgres.

Everything here goes through ``create_app()``. ADR 0001 records why that is not
negotiable: a device layer that was never mounted hid behind a green suite for a
whole phase, because the integration tests built their own FastAPI app. So there
is no local app in this file, no substitute for Postgres, and the device
credential is minted by running the real pairing protocol.

The floor is moved the way an operator moves it - by changing configuration and
letting the platform re-read it - never by editing a constant or patching a
function. A test that reached into the code to change the floor would prove the
opposite of what this issue is for: the whole point is that a known-bad agent can
be stopped without shipping anything.
