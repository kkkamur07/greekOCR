"""The signed page image link, end to end against the real app and real storage.

Everything here goes through ``create_app()`` and the configured media store.
There is no stub storage client and no local FastAPI app - ADR 0001 records what
a test-local app cost this project the last time, and a faked media store would
make the one claim under test ("the link reaches real bytes in the real store")
unfalsifiable.

The media store exercised here is the **local** backend, which is what this
repository runs outside production. Its signature is minted and checked by the
platform. The Supabase backend signs with Storage's own key, and there is no
Supabase running in this environment - see the module docstring of
``test_media_store_signed_urls`` for what is and is not covered there.

**No test here sleeps.** Expiry is proven by asking the real signer for a link
whose deadline is already in the past, and by showing that a deadline moved
forward in the URL no longer verifies. A ``sleep(61)`` would assert the same
thing sixty-one seconds more slowly and flake on a loaded machine.
